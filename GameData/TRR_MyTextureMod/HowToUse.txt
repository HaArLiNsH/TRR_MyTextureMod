You can use this custom folder to host your texture for TRR. 

You can either use it like it is or you can change the name TRR_MyTextureMod to your linking. 

The name that you will choose must goes alphabetically AFTER TextureReplacerReplaced ! 

I suggest you to use the prefix TRR_   and then use the name you want.


If you change the name you have to use the same name in this locations : 

- The name of the folder that goes in GameData/ 
- The name of the file TRR_MyTextureMod.cfg
- inside that .cfg : 

TextureReplacerReplaced
	{
		Folders
					{
						Default = TRR_MyTextureMod/Default/
						EnvMap = TRR_MyTextureMod/EnvMap/
						Heads = TRR_MyTextureMod/Heads/
						Suits = TRR_MyTextureMod/Suits/		
					}
	}

You can also delete the "TRR_MyTextureMod.version" file if you change the name.
